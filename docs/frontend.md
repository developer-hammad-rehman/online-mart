# Online Mart Client
This is the client-side application for Online Mart, an e-commerce platform built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript.

# Getting Started
The client application you're referring to is designed to provide a user interface for authenticating users with a custom GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model using the OAuth protocol. This client application serves as the front-end component of a larger system that integrates with a backend API and a GPT model.

The primary functionality of this client application is to handle the OAuth authentication flow, which typically involves the following steps:

# User Authentication : 
The client application will present a login screen or prompt the user to authenticate using their credentials (e.g., username and password) or an external identity provider (e.g., Google, Facebook, etc.).

# Authorization Request : 
Once the user is authenticated, the client application will initiate an authorization request to the backend API, which acts as the authorization server in the OAuth flow.

Consent and Authorization Grant : The backend API will present the user with the necessary consent screens, outlining the permissions and data access requested by the client application. If the user grants consent, the backend API will issue an authorization code or token.

# Token Exchange : 
The client application will exchange the authorization code or token with the backend API to obtain an access token and, optionally, a refresh token. [1]

Accessing Protected Resources : With the obtained access token, the client application can securely communicate with the backend API and access protected resources, such as the custom GPT model or other services.

The client application may also handle additional features related to the GPT integration, such as:

Providing a user interface for interacting with the GPT model, allowing users to input prompts or queries and receiving generated responses.

Displaying the generated responses from the GPT model in a user-friendly format.

Offering options to customize or configure the GPT model's behavior or settings.

Implementing caching mechanisms or rate-limiting to optimize performance and manage resource usage.

Providing error handling and feedback mechanisms for failed or unsuccessful GPT requests.

# Note

It's important to note that the client application is just one component of the overall system, and it relies on the backend API and the GPT model to function correctly. The backend API handles the authentication and authorization logic, as well as the integration with the GPT model, while the client application serves as the user interface and facilitates the communication between the user and the backend services.
